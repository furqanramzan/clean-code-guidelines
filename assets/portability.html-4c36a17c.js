A highly portable system can be easily moved from one platform or environment to another without requiring significant changes to the codebase.</p><p>There are several ways to improve the portability of a software system:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Platform independence</strong>: Using platform-independent technologies and programming languages that can run on multiple platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Using abstract classes and interfaces to provide a high-level view of the system, which makes it easier to understand and move to different platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Platform-specific code</strong>: Minimizing the use of platform-specific code and using platform-independent alternatives whenever possible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Configuration</strong>: Allowing the system to be configured or customized without modifying the codebase, making it easier to adapt to different platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing</strong>: Testing the system on multiple platforms to ensure that it runs correctly and identify any platform-specific issues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Containers</strong>: Using containers like Docker or Kubernetes to package the system and its dependencies together, making it easier to move between different environments.</p></li></ul><p>Improving the portability of a software system can help to ensure that the system can be easily adapted to different platforms or environments, which can help to increase its reach and adoption, save costs and resources in the long run and ensure the long-term success of the system.</p>',5),r=[s];function a(l,c){return t(),n("div",null,r)}const m=e(i,[["render",a],["__file","portability.html.vue"]]);export{m as default};
