A highly extendable software system is relatively easy to modify and expand, whereas a system that is not extendable is difficult to modify and expand.</p><p>When designing a software system, it is important to consider how easily the system can be extended to meet future requirements. This can be achieved by using a modular design, where the system is composed of small, independent, and replaceable modules. Also, by using well-defined interfaces and abstractions, it can make it easier to add new functionality without affecting existing code.</p><p>It&#39;s important to note that extendability is not the same as scalability, which refers to the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work. Extendability is about adding new features, scalability is about handling more work with the same features.</p><p>To achieve extensibility in your system or software, there are several best practices that you can follow, such as:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Use modular design</strong>: Break your system or software into small, independent modules that can be easily added, removed, or replaced as needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use interfaces and abstract classes</strong>: Interfaces and abstract classes provide a way to define a contract that must be implemented by any class that implements them, allowing for easy substitution of different implementations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use dependency injection</strong>: Dependency injection allows you to decouple the implementation of a class from the class that uses it, making it easy to substitute different implementations without modifying the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid hard-coding</strong>: Avoid hard-coding values or configurations in your code, instead use external configuration files or environment variables to make it easy to change them without modifying the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Document your code</strong>: Properly document your code to make it easier for other developers to understand and modify it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use testing</strong>: Write automated tests to ensure that your code is working as expected and to make it easier to identify and fix any issues that may arise when making changes.</p></li></ul><p>Remember that Extensibility is not a one-time job, it&#39;s an ongoing process and you should keep looking for ways to improve it.</p>',7),s=[n];function r(d,l){return t(),i("div",null,s)}const u=e(o,[["render",r],["__file","extendability.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
