It promotes a set of practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, and continuous integration to achieve these goals. XP aims to improve the quality of software and the communication within the development team.</p><p>XP promotes a set of specific practices to achieve its goals, such as:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pair programming</strong>: Two developers work together at one computer, with one typing and the other reviewing the code. This improves communication, knowledge sharing, and code quality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test-driven development</strong>: Developers write automated tests for new features before writing the code. This ensures that the code is thoroughly tested and that it meets the requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Continuous integration</strong>: Developers integrate their code with the main codebase frequently, often several times a day. This helps to catch and fix integration issues early on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Small releases</strong>: XP encourages the delivery of small, usable chunks of software to the customer frequently, rather than one large release at the end of the project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simple design</strong>: XP promotes simple, easy-to-understand designs that are easy to change as requirements evolve.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refactoring</strong>: XP encourages developers to continually improve the design of the codebase.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collective ownership</strong>: XP promotes the idea that all team members are responsible for the codebase, rather than just a designated &quot;owner.&quot;</p></li></ul><p>XP also places a strong emphasis on communication and collaboration within the development team. This includes practices such as daily stand-up meetings, regular customer involvement, and a &quot;customer representative&quot; who acts as the liaison between the development team and the customer.</p><p>One of the core principles of XP is that the customer&#39;s needs and priorities should drive the development process. The customer is involved throughout the project, providing feedback and prioritizing features. This helps to ensure that the software meets the customer&#39;s needs and is delivered on time and within budget.</p><p>Overall, XP is a methodology that aims to deliver high-quality, working software quickly and efficiently, while also promoting teamwork and communication within the development team.</p>',7),a=[r];function n(l,h){return t(),o("div",null,a)}const p=e(i,[["render",n],["__file","xp.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
