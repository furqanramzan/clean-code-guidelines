A robust system or software can handle a wide range of inputs and can continue to function correctly even when it encounters unexpected or error conditions. This makes it more reliable and easier to maintain over time.</p><p>Robustness can be achieved by implementing certain design principles and best practices such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Error handling</strong>: providing a mechanism to catch and handle errors and exceptions, to prevent the system or software from crashing or producing incorrect results.</li><li><strong>Input validation</strong>: Checking the validity of inputs and rejecting any that are invalid or out of range, to prevent errors or unexpected behavior.</li><li><strong>Defensive programming</strong>: Anticipating and guarding against possible errors or exceptional conditions, to prevent the system or software from crashing or producing incorrect results.</li></ul><p>Having a robust system or software is important as it allows for the system or software to remain stable and continue functioning correctly even when faced with unexpected or adverse conditions. This makes it easier to maintain and adapt to changing requirements, which is crucial for achieving long-term success.</p>',5),s=[i];function a(c,d){return t(),n("div",null,s)}const h=e(o,[["render",a],["__file","robustness.html.vue"]]);export{h as default};
