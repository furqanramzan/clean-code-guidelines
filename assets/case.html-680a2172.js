Many programming languages are case-sensitive, meaning that the language treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct characters. This can have important implications for coding, as the use of the wrong case can result in errors or unexpected behavior in your program.</p><p>It is a good practice to use a consistent letter case style throughout your code. There are several common conventions for letter case in coding, including snake case, camel case, Pascal case, kebab case, and screaming snake case.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>It is important to choose a letter case style and be consistent with it in your code.
