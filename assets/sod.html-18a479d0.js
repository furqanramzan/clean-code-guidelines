Each section is independent of the other and thatâ€™s why each section can be tackled independently also it becomes easier to maintain, update, and reuse the code. This can be achieved by dividing a system into components or modules, each of which has a specific concern or responsibility. For example, in software development, separation of concerns can be implemented by dividing the code into different layers, such as a presentation layer, a business logic layer, and a data access layer. Each of these layers has a specific purpose, and changes to one layer should not affect the other layers, like saving data to a database has nothing to do with rendering the data on the web. This can help to make the system more modular, maintainable, and scalable.</p><h2 id="example" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Example</h2><p>Here&#39;s an example of the Separation of Concerns:</p><p>Imagine you are building an online store that allows customers to browse and purchase products. One way to apply separation of concerns is to divide the system into two entities: product and order.</p><ul><li><p>Product entity: This entity is responsible for storing and managing information about the products that are available for sale in the store. It might include data such as the product name, price, description, and image.</p></li><li><p>Order entity: This entity is responsible for storing and managing information about the orders that are placed by customers. It might include data such as the customer&#39;s name and shipping address, the products that were ordered, the quantity of each product, and the total price of the order.</p></li></ul><p>By dividing the system into these two entities, you can isolate the different concerns of the online store and make it easier to manage and modify the data. For example, you can work on the product entity without having to worry about how it will affect the order entity or vice versa. This can help to make the system more modular and easier to maintain.</p>',7),s=[i];function r(d,c){return t(),a("div",null,s)}const p=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","sod.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
