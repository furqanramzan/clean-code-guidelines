While it seems reasonable to take a more existential stance, that it does not matter when they&#39;re written as long as they are written, but this is wrong. Writing the test first makes a difference.</p></li></ul>',3),r=[n];function i(l,d){return e(),s("div",null,r)}const u=t(o,[["render",i],["__file","first.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
