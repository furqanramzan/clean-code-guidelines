Dependability can be further divided into three main characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Reliability</strong>: The ability of a system to perform its intended functions correctly and consistently over a period of time.</li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: The proportion of time that a system is operational and able to perform its intended functions.</li><li><strong>Safety</strong>: The absence of accidental or unintended harm to the system or its environment.</li></ul><p>A system with high dependability can be trusted to perform its intended functions correctly and consistently, even under adverse conditions such as hardware failures, software bugs, or network outages.</p><p>Improving dependability can involve practices such as testing and validating the system, creating a robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and applying design patterns and best practices for fault tolerance and error handling.</p><p>It is important to note that dependability is a relative concept, and the level of dependability that is required for a given system will depend on the specific use case and the potential impact of failures.</p>',6),o=[r];function s(d,c){return t(),i("div",null,o)}const h=e(a,[["render",s],["__file","dependability.html.vue"]]);export{h as default};
