A highly usable system is easy to learn, easy to use, and efficient to use.</p><p>Several key factors contribute to the usability of a software system, such as:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Learnability</strong>: The ease with which new users can learn and become proficient with the system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The speed and accuracy with which experienced users can accomplish tasks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Memorability</strong>: The ease with which users can remember how to use the system after a period of non-use.</p></li><li><p><strong>Errors</strong>: The rate and severity of errors that users make while using the system, and the ease with which they can recover from them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Satisfaction</strong>: The degree to which users find the system pleasant to use.</p></li></ul><p>Improving the usability of a software system can involve practices such as user-centered design, usability testing, and user feedback. By considering usability in the design and development process, developers can create software that is easy to learn, easy to use, and efficient to use, which can lead to a better user experience and higher adoption of the system.</p>',5),o=[r];function n(c,h){return s(),t("div",null,o)}const d=e(a,[["render",n],["__file","usability.html.vue"]]);export{d as default};
