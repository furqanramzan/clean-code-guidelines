A highly maintainable system can be easily modified or extended to meet changing requirements, without introducing new bugs or causing existing functionality to break.</p><p>A system with high maintainability is easier to update, modify, and troubleshoot, which can save time and resources in the long run. Also, it is more likely to meet the needs of users and stakeholders as they change over time.</p><p>Improving maintainability can involve practices such as refactoring code, creating clear and consistent documentation, and applying design patterns and best practices. Following principles such as SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, and the Boy Scout rule can also help to improve maintainability.</p><p>There are several strategies and best practices that can be used to achieve maintainable software:</p><ul><li><p>Use clear and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.</p></li><li><p>Write clean, readable, and well-documented code. Use comments to explain the purpose and operation of the code.</p></li><li><p>Use modular design principles to break the system down into small, independent, and reusable components.</p></li><li><p>Use version control to track changes to the codebase over time and make it easy to roll back or revert to previous versions.</p></li><li><p>Use automated testing to ensure that changes to the code do not break existing functionality.</p></li><li><p>Follow industry standards and best practices for coding, such as SOLID, DRY and KISS principles.</p></li><li><p>Regularly review and refactor the codebase to remove redundancies, improve performance, and make it more readable.</p></li><li><p>Continuously improve the development process and the team&#39;s skills by using methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, and DevOps.</p></li></ul>',6),s=[o];function r(l,c){return t(),i("div",null,s)}const m=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","maintainability.html.vue"]]);export{m as default};
