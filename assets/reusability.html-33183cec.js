A highly reusable system can be easily used or reused in other projects or contexts without requiring significant changes to the codebase.</p><p>There are several ways to improve the reusability of a software system:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Modularity</strong>: Creating a modular design that separates the different components of the system and allows them to be easily reused in other projects or contexts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Using abstract classes and interfaces to provide a high-level view of the system, which makes it easier to understand and reuse in other projects or contexts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Encapsulating the system&#39;s internal state and behavior, makes it easier to reuse the system without affecting other parts of the codebase.</p></li><li><p><strong>API</strong>: Exposing an API that allows external systems to interact with the system, making it easy to reuse and integrate with other systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design patterns</strong>: Using design patterns to provide a common language and structure for the system&#39;s components, which makes it easier to reuse and understand.</p></li></ul><p>Improving the reusability of a software system can help to save costs and resources in the long run, as well as make it easier to maintain and evolve the system over time. It also enables developers to focus on the business logic rather than spending time on lower-level implementation details.</p>',5),n=[r];function i(l,c){return t(),s("div",null,n)}const u=e(a,[["render",i],["__file","reusability.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
