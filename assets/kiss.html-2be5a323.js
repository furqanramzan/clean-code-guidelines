By keeping things simple, designers can reduce the risk of errors and mistakes, and can also make it easier for users to learn and use the system or process.</p><p>The KISS principle is often used in software development to help programmers write clear, concise, and maintainable code. It can also be applied to other areas of design, such as user interface design and product design.</p><p>Overall, the KISS principle is a useful reminder to strive for simplicity and clarity in design and to avoid adding unnecessary complexity that can make things harder to use and understand.</p><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>After you finish the first 90% of a project, you have to finish the other 90%. <strong>MICHAEL ABRASH</strong></p></div><h2 id="example" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Example</h2><p>Here is an example of how the KISS principle might be applied in software development:</p><p>Imagine that you are designing a new feature for a web application that allows users to search for products. One way to approach this task might be to design a complex search interface with many different options and filters, such as price range, color, size, brand, and so on. However, this approach might be unnecessarily complex and could lead to a confusing and overwhelming user experience.</p><p>Instead, you might apply the KISS principle by designing a simple search interface with just a single text field for users to enter their search terms. This simple design would be easy for users to understand and use, and it would also be easier to implement and maintain than a more complex design.</p><p>This is just one example of how the KISS principle can be applied, but the basic idea is to strive for simplicity and clarity in design to make things easier to use and understand.</p>',11),r=[n];function o(d,p){return i(),a("div",null,r)}const l=e(s,[["render",o],["__file","kiss.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
