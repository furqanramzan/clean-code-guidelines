The principle suggests that a unit test should be broken down into three distinct parts:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Arrange</strong>: In the &quot;arrange&quot; step, the developer sets up the test by creating objects, initializing variables, and providing any necessary inputs for the test.</p></li><li><p><strong>Act</strong>: In the &quot;act&quot; step, the developer calls the method or function that is being tested.</p></li><li><p><strong>Assert</strong>: In the &quot;assert&quot; step, the developer checks that the output of the method or function is as expected.</p></li></ul><p>The AAA pattern is a good way to make sure the tests are easy to understand, easy to debug and easy to maintain, which can help to improve the overall quality of the software and make the testing process more efficient and effective.</p>',4),r=[a];function i(c,h){return e(),o("div",null,r)}const u=t(n,[["render",i],["__file","aaa.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
