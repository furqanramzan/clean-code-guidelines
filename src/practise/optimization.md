## Introduction

::: tip

Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming. **Donald Knuth**

:::

Premature optimization is the act of optimizing a system or component before it is necessary. This can involve optimizing code, algorithms, data structures, or other aspects of a system in an attempt to make it faster, more efficient, or more scalable, without a clear understanding of whether or not such optimization is necessary.

Premature optimization is generally considered to be a bad practice in software development because it can lead to unnecessarily complex code, longer development times, and a higher risk of introducing bugs and other issues. It can also distract from more important tasks, such as improving the overall design and architecture of a system.

Instead of focusing on premature optimization, it is often more effective to focus on writing clean, well-structured, and maintainable code. This allows you to build a solid foundation for your system, which can then be optimized as needed once it is in use and its performance characteristics are better understood.

If you optimize your code in the beginning and case the requirement may change then your efforts will be wasted and your code will go into the garbage. So it’s better to optimize the algorithm at the right time to get the right benefit from it.

::: tip

Never optimize a program until it is correct, working and unless necessary.
