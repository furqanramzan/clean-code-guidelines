## Introduction

Readability refers to the ease with which other developers can understand and work with the code. This can be affected by factors such as the use of clear and descriptive variable and function names, the structure and organization of the code, the use of comments and documentation, and the adherence to coding conventions and best practices.

Good readability in code makes it easier to maintain and update the code, as well as to collaborate with other developers. It can also help prevent errors and bugs and make it easier to identify and fix them when they do occur.
