## Introduction

The terms "extensibility" and "extendability" are often used interchangeably, but they do have slightly different meanings.

Extensibility refers to the ability of a system or software to easily accommodate future changes or additions without requiring extensive modifications to the original code. It is a measure of how easy it is to add new functionality to a system or software without disrupting existing functionality.

Extendability, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a system or software to be extended or expanded in the future. It is a measure of the potential for a system or software to be enhanced or modified with additional functionality.

In other words, extensibility is a characteristic of a system or software, while extendability is a potential of a system or software.

A system or software can be designed to be highly extensible, making it easy to add new functionality, but it may not have the potential to be extended in certain areas. On the other hand, a system or software can be designed to have the potential to be extended in many different areas, but it may not be easy to add new functionality without disrupting existing functionality.

In summary, Extensibility is about how easy it is to add new functionality to a system or software without disrupting existing functionality, whereas Extendability is about the potential for a system or software to be enhanced or modified with additional functionality.
