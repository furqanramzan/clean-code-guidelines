## Introduction

Dependability is a measure of the degree to which a software system can be relied upon to perform its intended functions correctly and consistently, even in the presence of errors or failures. Dependability can be further divided into three main characteristics:

- **Reliability**: The ability of a system to perform its intended functions correctly and consistently over a period of time.
- **Availability**: The proportion of time that a system is operational and able to perform its intended functions.
- **Safety**: The absence of accidental or unintended harm to the system or its environment.

A system with high dependability can be trusted to perform its intended functions correctly and consistently, even under adverse conditions such as hardware failures, software bugs, or network outages.

Improving dependability can involve practices such as testing and validating the system, creating a robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and applying design patterns and best practices for fault tolerance and error handling.

It is important to note that dependability is a relative concept, and the level of dependability that is required for a given system will depend on the specific use case and the potential impact of failures.
