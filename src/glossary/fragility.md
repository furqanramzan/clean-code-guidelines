## Introduction

Fragility refers to the tendency of a system or software to break or malfunction when changes or additions are made to it. A system or software that is fragile is sensitive to changes, even small ones, and can easily become unstable or stop working correctly. This can make it difficult and time-consuming to maintain the system or software, and can also make it difficult to adapt to changing requirements or user needs.
