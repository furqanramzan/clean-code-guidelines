## Introduction

Refactoring is the process of changing the structure or organization of existing code, without changing its external behavior. This can include things like renaming variables, moving functions to different files or modules, and reorganizing the overall architecture of the codebase. The goal of refactoring is typically to improve the maintainability, readability, and overall quality of the code while ensuring that existing functionality is not affected.
