## Introduction

Immobility refers to the inability of a system or software to be reused or repurposed for other projects or uses. A system or software that is immobile is difficult to move or adapt to other contexts and often requires extensive modifications to the original code to be used differently. This can make it difficult to leverage existing code and resources, and can also make it difficult to adapt to changing requirements or user needs.
