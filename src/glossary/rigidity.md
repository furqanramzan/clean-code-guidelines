## Introduction

Rigidity refers to the inability of a system or software to easily accommodate changes or additions without requiring extensive modifications to the original code. A system or software that is rigid is difficult to modify or extend, and often requires extensive changes to the existing code base to add new functionality or make changes. This can make it difficult and time-consuming to maintain the system or software, and can also make it difficult to adapt to changing requirements or user needs.

To avoid rigidity, it's crucial to design and implement systems and software with extensibility in mind. By following best practices such as modular design, use of interfaces and abstract classes, dependency injection, and testing, it will be much easier to make changes and add new functionality to the system or software in the future.
