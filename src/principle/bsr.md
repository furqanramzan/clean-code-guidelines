## Introduction

The "Boy Scout Rule" is a principle from Extreme Programming (XP) that states: "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it."

In the context of software development, this means that when working on a codebase, developers should not only fix bugs and add new features but also take the time to clean up and improve the existing code. This can include things like refactoring code to make it more readable, reducing duplicated code, and removing unnecessary or outdated code. By following the Boy Scout Rule, developers can ensure that the codebase remains maintainable and easy to understand, even as the project grows and evolves over time.

This rule also implies that developers should take into consideration the long-term impact of their changes and commit to maintaining the codebase over time.
